# Monsters and Stuff

Requires Python 3 and Pygame.

## How to run locally in windows:
1. install latest python 3
2. from command prompt or powershell, go to the `src` directory
3. run `python.exe -m venv venv`
    - you can replace `python.exe` with the full path to the appropriate file if it's not in your path
4. run `venv\Scripts\activate`
5. run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
6. run `python main.py`

- In the future, you should only need to take steps 2, 4, and 6.
- Alternately, you can use pycharm or some other IDE that will handle virtual environment for you.
