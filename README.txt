Gameplay:
  This is more of a VN / pet sim than anything else, but if you want to win
fights some actions are better than others. See if you can figure out what the
right option is for your monster!
  Monsters are randomly generated; there are 27 visual possibilities for new
monsters and 708,588 for each level above that (59,049 body types * 12
colorways). Across all levels, that's 2,125,791 monsters! Needless to say, you
do not have to catch them all.
