Gameplay:
  This is more of a visual novel / pet sim than anything else, but if you
want to win fights, some actions are better than others. See if you can
figure out what the right option is for your monster!
  Monsters are randomly generated; there are 27 visual possibilities for new
monsters and 708,588 for each level above that (59,049 body types * 12
colorways). Across all levels, that's 2,125,791 monsters! Needless to say,
you do not have to catch them all.
