style conventions for this project

modules: lowercaseletters
classes: UpperCamelCase
methods: lowerCamelCase
variables: lowercase_separated_by_underscores
constants: UPPERCASE_SEPARATED_BY_UNDERSCORES

strings: use single quotes (') for things acting as identifiers (example: dictionaries, file names)
use triple double quotes for docstrings (""")
use double quotes otherwise (")

definitions: place a blank line after function definitions
additional single blank lines can be placed for readability / structure

"private" functions: though python does not have private functions,
use a single leading underscore to indicate that something should be private to the class

# comments should have a space after the octothorpe
