instead of holding shared state in gamemode class, hold it in game
	just pass it to the modes each function
	GameMode.shared['font_wrap'] -> shared_state.fontWrap

move shared convomode and fight mode stuff into new class
	basically just
		black_box = pygame.image.load(os.path.join(sprite_path, 'blackbox.png'))
	and conversion
	and some input stuff

switch over to python string formatting

wrap movement for fight inside monsters or a new class

make and check settings file (main.py or game.py?)
	window size
	fullscreen
	max framerate
	etc

saving the game!
	loading
	saving to an existing save file name
	buttons?

re-evaluate mon stats
	tally up results for winners for different possible distributions of stats
	balancing that
	maybe check that can be strategy to fight choices?

variable frame rate (should only need to input time information into the update functions

lower priority:
	(maybe) scroll slider thingy for convomode.py, click-and-drag-able
