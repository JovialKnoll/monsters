1) finish opening
    one more goofy logo?
    looping title screen
2) music / sound
3) content for convos and fights (based on each other)
4) save implementation in some modes, only show save options if implemented
    (specific to modes + shared state, no generic pickling)
5) load implementation
6) make and check settings file (main.py or game.py?)
	window size
	fullscreen
	max framerate
	etc
7) build exes for playing without python and pygame installed
8) https://github.com/wasmerio/wasmer-python

saving the game!
	https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html#object.__getstate__
	loading
	saving to an existing save file name
	buttons?
	make a class to handle saves

re-evaluate mon stats
	tally up results for winners for different possible distributions of stats
	balancing that
	maybe check that can be strategy to fight choices?

lower priority:
	(maybe) scroll slider thingy for convomode.py, click-and-drag-able
