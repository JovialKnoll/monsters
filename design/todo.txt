necessary:
1) music / sound
    convo music
    opening music
2) content for convos and fights
    first convo with monster
    outline for plot
    first fight
3) replace WAVs with OGGs
4) linux bugs:
    holding down a button seems to activate keydown event multiple times
        check if need to explicitly disallow with pygame.key.set_repeat or something
    fullscreen breaks
        seems to be an actual pygame bug, either wait for a fix, help, or workaround
5) try to make cleaner directory later

optional:
1) get rid of button outline for unused buttons (ConvoMode)
2) transition / fade options for convos?
3) make sounds play with particular left / right volumes instead of being centered
4) deduplicate shared code in convo and fight modes around boxes
5) re-evaluate mon stats
    tally up results for winners for different possible distributions of stats
    balancing that
    maybe check that there can be strategy to fight choices?
