secret project

move shared convomode and fight mode stuff into new class
	basically just
		black_box = pygame.image.load(os.path.join(sprite_path, 'blackbox.png'))
	and conversion
	and some input stuff

switch string concatenation over to .format() or f-strings for most cases

make and check settings file (main.py or game.py?)
	window size
	fullscreen
	max framerate
	etc

saving the game!
	https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html#object.__getstate__
	loading
	saving to an existing save file name
	buttons?
	make a class to handle saves

re-evaluate mon stats
	tally up results for winners for different possible distributions of stats
	balancing that
	maybe check that can be strategy to fight choices?

variable frame rate? (should only need to input time information into the update functions

lower priority:
	(maybe) scroll slider thingy for convomode.py, click-and-drag-able
