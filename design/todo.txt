necessary:
1) finish opening
    need a logo to put on the looping screen
2) music / sound
    opening music
    fight sounds
        defend and escape sounds
    fight music
    convo music
    maybe more
    make sounds play with particular left / right volumes instead of being centered
3) content for convos and fights (based on each other)
4) save implementation in some modes, only show save options if implemented
    (specific to modes + shared state, no generic pickling)
    https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html#object.__getstate__
    saving to an existing save file name
    make a class to handle saves?
5) load implementation
6) make and check settings file (main.py or game.py?)
	window size
	fullscreen
	max framerate
	etc
7) build exes for playing without python and pygame installed
8) https://github.com/wasmerio/wasmer-python

optional:
1) pause time measuring, updating when moving window
    maybe also when window loses focus
2) re-evaluate mon stats
	tally up results for winners for different possible distributions of stats
	balancing that
	maybe check that can be strategy to fight choices?
3) deduplicate shared code in convo and fight modes around boxes
4) scroll slider thingy for convomode.py, click-and-drag-able
