necessary:
1) music / sound
    convo music
    opening music
2) introduction to monster mode
3) content for convos and fights (based on each other)
    make system for convo modes to move through entire conversation in single mode
4) linux bugs:
    fullscreen breaks (probably using unsupported flags, add a check for which flags can be used
    holding down a button seems to activate keydown event multiple times
        check if need to explicitly disallow with pygame.key.set_repeat or something
5) try to make cleaner directory later

optional:
1) make sounds play with particular left / right volumes instead of being centered
2) deduplicate shared code in convo and fight modes around boxes
3) re-evaluate mon stats
    tally up results for winners for different possible distributions of stats
    balancing that
    maybe check that can be strategy to fight choices?
4) replace WAVs with OGGs
