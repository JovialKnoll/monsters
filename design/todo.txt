make it easier to make opening
    utility: make function for lerping, maybe also for other interpolation
    modefight: let monsters handle animation, using lerping
        monster: inherit from object (inheriting from sprite)
            that tracks positions to lerp between, alters own rect for drawing
            to add a new movement, def moveTo(position, time(ms), [interpolation type?])
                also: def moveToRelative(position, time, [interpolation type?])
            track animation_time (subtract current movement's time once you go over to find where you are in the next movement,
            set to 0 when no movements left)
            update: set new animation time and rect
        set monster rects and directions at start of fight
    monster: get rid of the special draw functions, let people just set the special attributes on its rect
    variable frame rate (should only need to input time information into the update functions

have gamemode.py track pressed mouse buttons + pressed joy buttons
    in addition to pressed keys
    helpful: event objects can be printed

move shared convomode and fight mode stuff into new class
	basically just
		black_box = pygame.image.load(os.path.join(sprite_path, 'blackbox.png'))
	and conversion
	and some input stuff

switch string concatenation over to .format() or f-strings for most cases

make and check settings file (main.py or game.py?)
	window size
	fullscreen
	max framerate
	etc

saving the game!
	https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html#object.__getstate__
	loading
	saving to an existing save file name
	buttons?
	make a class to handle saves

re-evaluate mon stats
	tally up results for winners for different possible distributions of stats
	balancing that
	maybe check that can be strategy to fight choices?

lower priority:
	(maybe) scroll slider thingy for convomode.py, click-and-drag-able
