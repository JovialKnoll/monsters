make it easier to make opening
    modefight: let monsters handle animation, using lerping
        set monster rects and directions at start of fight
    variable frame rate (should only need to input time information into the update functions

have gamemode.py track pressed mouse buttons + pressed joy buttons
    in addition to pressed keys
    helpful: event objects can be printed

move shared convomode and fight mode stuff into new class
	basically just
		black_box = pygame.image.load(os.path.join(sprite_path, 'blackbox.png'))
	and conversion
	and some input stuff

make and check settings file (main.py or game.py?)
	window size
	fullscreen
	max framerate
	etc

saving the game!
	https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html#object.__getstate__
	loading
	saving to an existing save file name
	buttons?
	make a class to handle saves

re-evaluate mon stats
	tally up results for winners for different possible distributions of stats
	balancing that
	maybe check that can be strategy to fight choices?

lower priority:
    switch string concatenation over to .format() or f-strings for most cases
	(maybe) scroll slider thingy for convomode.py, click-and-drag-able
