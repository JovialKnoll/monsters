We're always trying to get more participants for the human-monster mentorship program, so it really means a lot.",>,1,,,,,,
1,,"Now I know some of you have been here before, but I can see at least a few new faces among us.

So, I'll go ahead and give an overview of our program before we get started.",>,2,,,,,,
2,,"Basically, while there is a long history of human-monster collaboration, many towns, like ours, have established formalized programs in the last few years.",>,3,,,,,,
3,,Our program has two main goals:,>,4,,,,,,
4,,One: To maintain relations between humans and monsters.,>,5,,,,,,
5,,Two: To help young monsters figure out who they want to be and how they want to fit into society while taking their needs into account.,>,6,,,,,,
6,,"This is not, as some say, merely a ""fight club"" for ""training monsters to punch each other.""",>,7,,,,,,
7,,"Monster adolescence necessarily involves plenty of fighting, but this is an important part of their culture and at no point are they in actual danger.",>,8,,,,,,
8,,"Also, while you will be providing advice and coaching, we hope that you will be not merely a ""trainer,"" but a friend to your assigned monster.",>,9,,,,,,
9,,"You're only expected to spend time with your assigned monster until they reach adulthood, but it's our hope that most participants in this program will form lifelong friendships and still check in on your monster from time to time after the program ends.",>,10,,,,,,
10,,"Now, were there any questions?",Yes,10a,No,13,,,,
10a,,What would you like to know?,Do we need to feed them?,11a,Can they hurt us?,11b,Why have human mentors?,11c,Why do they fight?,11d
11a,,"Nope, monsters barely need to eat. They are quite adept at hunting and foraging from a young age.",>,12,,,,,,
11b,,"Young monsters aren't much larger than a small dog, and they've all been told to be on their best behavior.",>,12,,,,,,
11c,,"Adult monsters traditionally don't provide much instruction to young monsters, and with the demands of modern society, it's more important than ever that young monsters learn to work with humans.

There's a cultural exchange element too, and we hope that our human participants will also find this program informative.",>,12,,,,,,
11d,,"Why do humans sleep? We have some ideas, but ultimately it boils down to ""they have to."" This is not just a cultural value, but actually important for their health.",>,12,,,,,,
12,,Did you have any other questions?,Yes,10a,No,13,,,,
13,,"No? Let's move on to introductions, then.",>,14,,,,,,
14,,"Okay, so your monster's name is...{MONSTER_NAME}.

{MONSTER_NAME}, where are you?

Oh, there you are!",>,15,,,,,,
