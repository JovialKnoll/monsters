#conversation class goes here
#should inherit from game class, be very similar
#__init__ should take in text file with conversation stuff, parse it for options and stuff
#might need to take in monster sprite too, stuff like that
#when done, will return needed values to the game

#needs __init__, input, update, draw
#does not need self.time
