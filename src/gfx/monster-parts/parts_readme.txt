Naming conventions and info for monster parts:

level-bodypart-group[number]

level will be a number 0-3.
Bodyparts are: head, arms, legs, body, tail.
Groups are capital letters, followed by number (except for level 0).

Whenever a monster levels up, each body part can change into any part in the same group. It does not have to have the same number.
For example, 1-arms-A1 could change into 2-arms-A1, 2-arms-A2, or 2-arms-A3.

Different body parts can be of different groups; for example you can have a head from group A and a body from group B.
